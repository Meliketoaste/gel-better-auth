# Gel/EdgeDB Adapter for Better-Auth

## Status

Not working:
The create part is implemented. It can create tables and sessions.

It now can pass some more tests. Though it feel pretty hacky. Some basic select.

Gonna try to see if i can use the query builder as an parameter for the adapter, instead of type manually creating strings that sometimes need types.
