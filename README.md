# Gel/EdgeDB Adapter for Better-Auth

## Status

Might work:
Passing essentially all the tests, except avoiding to throw on error.

Tests might be lacking in rigor. Since the main tests assumes you can change set id i had to change some stuff.

TODO:

- Implement missing stuff,
- Add missing operators.
- Error handling.
- Test refactor
- Schema gen
