# Gel/EdgeDB Adapter for Better-Auth

## Status

Not working:
The create part is implemented. It can create tables and sessions.

I'm passing an big amount of the tests, but the code isn't very great. I am pretty sure there is some way of doing this with half the lines of code. Just having an more composable way of doing things.
